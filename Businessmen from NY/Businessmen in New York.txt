Businessman from New York - control overview

1. Stutter start: Either attackdetection or manual button

2. Stutter pause: Not stopping playback, but toggle silencing output on and off

3. Reverse: Toggle reverse playback of buffer on and off

4. Stutter Window Size: Pot/fader control 
What should be max and minimum? Easier to get similarbehaviour if we use same buffer length 

5. Stutter speed: Pot/fader control with option of going through different quantisation scales

6. Speed coarse: Pot/fader - a speed multiplier for coarse control of stutter speed 

7. Speed/quantisation scales: Button to step through different scales (chromatic, harmonic etc.)

8. Random speed
    8.1 - Speed (at 0, select new rand. values for each new stutter)
    8.2 - On/off - toggle random speed on and off

9. Random window size
    9.1 - Speed (at 0, select new rand. values for each new stutter)
    9.2 - On/off - toggle random speed on and off

10. Random sequence -> True random: Pot/fader 
    A repeating random sequence on one end to non-repeating random on the other end. Will make gradual changes 
    in between

11. Transpose - static argument for when running several instances and you want them transposed in relation@
    to each other

12. Volume output: Pot/fader 


TODO/Future ideas:

- Get rid of clicks on playback

- Implement backwards + forwards stutter for more freezelike effects

- Envelopes on playback windows for smoother repition - more freezelike

- Overlapping playbacks? For freeze/granular effects

- Beat detection for quantizing window sizes

- Adding more adaptive behaviour - envelope follower for controlling for instance speed etc.

- Should we consider other FX on the output or input? Like filtering, compression or distortion? Could also just be done outside the effect.
